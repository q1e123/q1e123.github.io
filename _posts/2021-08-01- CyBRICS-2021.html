        <h2 id="ad-network">Ad Network</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        We are so tired of advertising on the internet. It feels like it breaks the internet. Try to follow the ad, try to follow its rules.
        <br><br>
        Adnetwork website
        <br><br>
        There is a flag 1337 redirects deep into the network...
        <br>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        The Adnetwork website has a lot of redirects. By default most browsers have a limit of 20 redirects or so. To increase the limit I've used <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077395/increase-allowed-redirects-in-browser#:~:text=In%20Firefox%2C%20navigate%20to%20about,value%20to%20your%20desired%20value.">this StackOverflow post</a> to increase the limit to get the flag.
