Reasons not to use Windows 10

* **Windows Subsystem for Linux** : Is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables. Baiscly you have linux on Windows without installing linux in a VM. Sounds great right? If you need something from linux you can have it without installing it. Only if the implamantation wasn't so bad. I've almost managed to delete all the files that a classmate was having on his laptop because the gods from MS decided that the WLS shouldn't be isolated at all. What a great choice! Now imagine what would happen if you would let your SSH open...

Thank you Microsft for creating such a great product!
