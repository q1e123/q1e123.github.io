<h1>Introduction</h1>
There are situations where you will want to run the same instructions for more than one time. There are two solutions to do that: one that's stupid and one that isn't. The stupid solution would be to copy and paste the code, but this is having a little problem: what will you do if you need to run the code an unknown number of times? Also if you need to run the same code for a lot of time do you really wanna to stay and copy and paste? The solution is pretty simple: you can use a repetitive statement.

<h1>while</h1>
This is the most basic form of a repetitive is the while loop. It will repeat it's content as long as a condition is true. You will mostly use it when you don't know how many times the code will need to repeat. The syntax is:
{% highlight cpp %}
while(condition){
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
<br>
<h2>Example</h2>
{% highlight cpp %}
int x=0;
while(x < 5){
    std::cout<<"*";
    ++x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will print <i>*****</i>.

<h1>for</h1>
for is another form of a repetitive loop. It's very similar to the while statement. You will mostly use it when you know the number of times the code needs to repeat. The syntax is:

{% highlight cpp %}
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
    ...
} 
{% endhighlight %}
It works like this:
<ol>
    <li>init- here you can declare variables. This is done only at the beginning of for </li> 
    <li>condition- if this condition is false than the code will stop executing. This is done before every repetition. </li> 
    <li>increment- here you can increment variables. This is done at the end of each repetition</li> 
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

{% highlight cpp %}
for ( int x = 0; x < 5; ++x ) {
    std::cout<<"*";
} 
{% endhighlight %}

This will print <i>*****</i>.

<b>init, condition and increment are optional. You can skip them and just put ; .</b>
